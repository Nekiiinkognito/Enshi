export const pText = `The goal of typography is to relate font size, line
                        height, and line width in a proportional way that
                        maximizes beauty and makes reading easier and more
                        pleasant. The question is: What proportion(s) will give
                        us the best results? The golden ratio is often observed
                        in nature where beauty and utility intersect; perhaps we
                        can use this “divine” proportion to enhance these
                        attributes in our typography.`;
